      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a husband, father of two, and work with a great technology team at Aaron's.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm a native Georgian, born and raised in Marietta.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing tennis, cards, and love reading. I like finding new restaraunts.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>One job probably wouldn't be enough. I enjoy the work I do today, and also love teaching. I think being active in business, and bringing that to teaching provides the most value.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in a special triange of Kennesaw, Acworth, and Powder Springs. Apple weather has a hard time zeroing in on one location. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I don't specifically want to be a web developer, as much as I am a lifelong learner. It's been several years since I wrote code as my job, and wanted to catch-up on some newer technologies and techniques.</p>
